<h1> Summary </h1>
<h2>Python language translation project for AI & Application Development</h2>


<p>
This project is part of the:<br>
<b>"IBM Applied AI Professional Certificate"</b> on<br>
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/applied-artifical-intelligence-ibm-watson-ai">Coursera</a> 
</p>

<p>
According to IBM:<br>
"This mini-course is intended to apply foundational Python skills by implementing different techniques to develop applications and AI powered solutions. Assume the role of a developer and unit test and package an application with the help of multiple hands-on labs. After completing this course you will have acquired the confidence to begin developing AI enabled applications using Python, build and run unit tests, and package the application for distribution."
</p>

<p>
This project includes several sub tasks:</p>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Developing a real-world project using the IBM language translation API </li>
    <li>Unit test in Python code and create a Python package </li>
    <li>Build, test, and package your Python application using Theia Labs </li>
    <li>Setting up a Flask web app for language translation. </li>
    <li>Password encryption with dot-env</li>
</ul>

<p>
For Github the project was modified by using Jupyter Notebooks.<br>
This makes it more user-friendly and allows to see immediate outputs without deploying code.<br>
However, this created new problems like running a Flask wep app from Jupyter.<br>
Normally you would do this using a Python IDE and the command line and not Jupyter.
</p>

<p>
The project is structured into sub-tasks / Jupyter notebooks.
